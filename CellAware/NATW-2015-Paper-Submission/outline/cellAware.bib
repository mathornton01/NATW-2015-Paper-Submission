abstract={This tutorial will give an introduction to a new defect-oriented test method called cell-aware. This new cell-aware method takes the layout of standard library cells into account when creating the cell-aware ATPG library view. The tutorial will cover the whole cell-aware library characterization flow consisting of a layout extraction step, an analog fault simulation step of all cell-internal bridges and opens and the cell-aware synthesis step to create the new cell-aware ATPG library views, which finally can be used in a normal chip design flow to generate production test patterns. These cell-aware production test patterns have a significantly higher quality than state-of-the-art patterns. Finally, production test results from several hundred thousand tested IC's are presented showing significant reduction of DPPM rates.},

title={When Optimized N-Detect Test Sets are Biased: An Investigation of Cell-Aware-Type Faults and N-Detect Stuck-At ATPG},
year={2014},
month={May},
pages={32-39},
abstract={Cell-aware faults have previously been proposed to more effectively detect defects within gates. At the same time, n-detect test sets that provide multiple detections of each stuck-at fault are often used to maximize the detection of unmodeled defects. However, n-detect test sets are often not particularly effective at fortuitously detecting all untargeted cell-aware faults. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of different types of n-detect ATPG test sets for efficiently detecting difficult cell-aware-type faults and explain why optimizing test sets for n- detect using stuck-at faults while still keeping pattern counts low can actually bias those test sets against the detection of some cell-aware type faults. We then investigate the addition of cell-aware top-off patterns for cell-aware-type faults that are shown to be functionally relevant through good state simulation, allowing such faults to be prioritized when testing resources are limited.},

year={2009},
month={July},
pages={430-435},
abstract={Post-silicon validation has recently drawn designers' attention due to its increasing impacts on the VLSI design cycle and cost. One key feature of the post-silicon validation is the use of spare cells. In the literature, most existing works focus on developing new delicate spare cell structures. On the other hand, the placement of spare cells has a crucial impact on the design cycle and cost of the post-silicon debugging; however, there exists not much work on this placement problem. In this paper, we propose the first spare-cell-aware analytical placement framework which predicts the spare cell requirement and considers spare cell insertion during global placement. We also propose a multilevel spare cell insertion technique which provides a more efficient spare cell planning and a better control of quality impact due to spare cell insertion. To guide the selection of available spare cell positions during insertion, we propose a mixed-integer-linear-programming formulation to determine the optimal spare cell positions. Experimental results show that our algorithm can averagely achieve 17-33% and 1.77-2.61X better quality of spare cell insertion than that of the existing spare cell insertion algorithms, UniSpare and PostSpare , on the tested real designs with 1-5% spare cell insertion rates.},

abstract={Devices manufactured in 20 nm and smaller geometry technologies will potentially be very large by today's standards, they will also have new characteristics implied by things like process variability and adoption of FinFET transistors. The industry has cumulatively adopted more and more sophisticated fault models that use timing as well as layout information. There is a growing body of experimental data showing it is still insufficient. The next area of focus will be the quality of test. Cell-aware test is one of the most promising approaches developed over the last five years aimed at improving the quality of test while maintaining the efficiency of gate-level approach. This approach combines two levels of abstraction to provide trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. The first step creates the cell-aware test library models. It starts with standard cell libraries and performs layout extraction. Realistic defects (bridges and opens) are injected into the SPICE netlist, and analog fault simulation is performed to determine the conditions under which the defects are detected. Those conditions are aggregated to create a compact and efficient representation of the libraries for ATPG done at the gate-level. Generation of library views for cell-aware test is performed only once for a given standard cell library. The final cell-aware ATPG generates the high quality test patterns based on the cell-aware library views. This guarantees that the investment in gate-level ATPG infrastructure could be efficiently utilized. The technology has been used on a number of high-volume industrial designs. The experimental data show a significant increase of defect coverage and the corresponding improvement of defect rate.},

abstract={Industry is facing increasingly tougher quality requirements for more complex ICs. To meet these quality requirements we need to improve the defect coverage. This paper presents a new methodology to significantly increase the defect coverage of the test patterns generated by ATPG tools. The fault model used during the ATPG is enhanced to directly target layout-based intra-cell faults. In contrast to previous techniques, such as gate-exhaustive, N-detect, or embedded-multi-detect, which either are too complex for real-world designs or merely improve the probability of detecting intra-cell defects, the new approach targets the actual root causes of intra-cell defects. The newly proposed cell-aware-methodology has been evaluated for 90 nm and 65 nm technologies on 1671 library cells and on 10 real industrial designs with up to 50 million faults. The experimental results show an average increase of 1.2% in defect coverage and a reduction of 420 ppm in escape rate for a 50 mm2 design.},

abstract={With the semiconductor manufacturing development following the trend into very-deep sub-micron technologies and thus making Moore's law a reality, the decrease in node size introduces new defect mechanisms in manufacturing. Still, the strict quality requirements especially related to the automotive industry stay the same. Traditional fault models like stuck-at and transition delay models which have been used for the digital logic of System-on-Chip designs may be successful in detecting most of the manufacturing defects, but not all of them. In this paper, the new Cell Aware fault model, which has been introduced by Mentor Graphics®, is being evaluated for usage in the automotive design process of Freescale™. Using a state-of-the-art microcontroller product manufactured in a CMOS 55nm process technology, the fault model is evaluated for test coverage and test cost (pattern count) and compared against the traditional fault models used by Freescale. The analysis is carried out by performing several experiments, especially focusing on reducing the test pattern count overhead.},

We present results from a cell-aware (CA) characterization flow for 216 cells, the pattern generation flow for a 130nm smart power design, and high-volume production test results achieved after testing multimillion parts. The idea behind CA tests is to detect cell-internal (CI) bridges, opens, leaking and high resistive transistor defects which are undetected with state-of-the-art tests. The production test results have shown that the CA tests detect various failing parts during a first wafer sort test which still resulted into unique failing parts after a second wafer sort test done at a different temperature and with additional tests. The obtained results encouraged us to continue this work beyond this paper to run further experiments with the final goal to eliminate the stuck-at (SA) and transition delay (TR) test by simultaneously improving the quality with CA tests which are a superset of SA and TR tests.},

abstract={Obtaining fault coverage information for functional input sequences is often very difficult. Although many simulation-based techniques have been proposed, they are generally computationally expensive, and if the input sequence changes, new expensive simulations must be run. In this paper, we propose a new type of hardware monitor for the probabilistic determination of how many times a fault was likely to have been covered during functional test or program execution. In addition to providing coverage information for functional test sequences - even those that have never been simulated - these monitors can also be used to determine the relative criticality of faults for the applications a user is running in real time. Thus, in the future, this method has the potential to provide new dynamic optimization capabilities for on-chip field testing.},

We present techniques to efficiently identify the most powerful circuit implications that can be checked for violations so that the fraction of errors detected can be maximized while minimizing the additional hardware overhead. Importantly, our approach does not require re-synthesis of the targeted logic; the checker logic is added off the critical path and is run in parallel with the regular control logic. Trade-offs can be easily made between additional coverage of errors and additional area overhead. Our results show that significant error detection is possible - even with only a 10% area overhead.},
